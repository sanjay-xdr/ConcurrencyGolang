// A WaitGroup in Go is a simple way to wait for multiple goroutines to finish their execution. Itâ€™s like a counter: when you launch a goroutine, you increase the counter, and when a goroutine finishes, it decreases the counter. The Wait() function is used to block the execution of the program until the counter is zero, meaning all the goroutines have finished.

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

func printSomething(s string, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	defer wg.Done()
	fmt.Println(s)
}

func WaitGroupExample() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	numbers := []int{
		1,
		2,
		3,
		4,
		5,
		6,
		7,
		8,
		9,
	}

	wg.Add(len(numbers))

	for i, x := range numbers {
		go printSomething(fmt.Sprintf("%d: %d", i+1, x), &wg)
	}

	wg.Wait()

	// time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
	wg.Add(1)
	printSomething("This is second thing to be printed", &wg)
}
